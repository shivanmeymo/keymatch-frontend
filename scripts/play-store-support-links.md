Subject: Lost Upload Key - App: KeyMatch (com.keymatch.app)

Hello Google Play Support,

I have lost the private key for my app's upload certificate and need assistance with a key reset.

App Details:
- Package Name: com.keymatch.app
- App Name: KeyMatch
- Expected Upload Key SHA1: 36:2E:91:FC:73:02:34:31:BC:E9:15:35:5B:14:34:9B:B0:65:1F:FB
- Current Key SHA1: D9:A1:1F:8E:1B:3E:63:01:FD:69:8B:8A:9A:C8:47:CE:36:A2:1F:EC

Issue:
- I have lost the private key for my original upload certificate
- Google Play App Signing is enabled for my app
- I can provide proof of ownership of the app
- I need a key reset to continue publishing updates

I have thoroughly searched my system and confirmed the original private key is missing. I can provide screenshots of my Play Console dashboard and app signing configuration as proof of ownership.

Please help me reset my upload key so I can continue publishing updates to my app.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```
