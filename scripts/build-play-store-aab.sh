Play Store AAB Build Summary
============================
Build Date: $(date)
Version: $VERSION
File: $AAB_NAME
Size: $AAB_SIZE
Location: build/app/outputs/bundle/release/$AAB_NAME

Next Steps:
1. Upload $AAB_NAME to Google Play Console
2. Test the AAB on internal testing track
3. Submit for review when ready

IMPORTANT: Make sure you're using the correct keystore that matches
the fingerprint expected by Google Play Console.
